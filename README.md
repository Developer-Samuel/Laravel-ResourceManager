## About Project

This project is a **User Management System** built with **Laravel**, **Vue.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It provides users with the ability to **log in**, **sign up**, and perform basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a **Resource** using Laravel as the backend and Vue.js for the frontend.

## Features

- User authentication (Login/Sign up)
- CRUD operations for managing user resources
- Responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS
- Routing and page management handled by Inertia.js
- Seamless integration between frontend (Vue.js) and backend (Laravel) without traditional API endpoints
- SQLite as the database for easy setup and development

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: Backend framework for handling requests, routing, and database management.
- **Vue.js**: Frontend framework used to build the user interface and handle dynamic interactions.
- **Inertia.js**: Handles routing between pages, providing a single-page application (SPA) experience without the need for an API. It enables direct communication between Vue.js and Laravel.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs without writing custom CSS.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight relational database used for easy setup and local development.

- Composer
- Node.js (which includes NPM)
- Laravel 11.x (or higher)

## SQLite Database Management

Since this project uses SQLite as the database, you can easily manage and visualize your SQLite database with the following tools:

- **SQLite Viewer Extension for VS Code**: A VS Code extension that allows you to open and interact with SQLite databases directly within the editor. You can find it in the Extensions Marketplace for VS Code.
  - [SQLite Viewer Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite)

- **DB Browser for SQLite**: A desktop application for managing SQLite databases. It provides a user-friendly interface to open, browse, and modify SQLite database files.
